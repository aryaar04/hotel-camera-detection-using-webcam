# hotel-camera-detection-using-webcam
This project focuses on detecting hidden or suspicious recording devices in hotel rooms using a combination of YOLOv5 object detection and webcam image capture through Google Colab. By utilizing a pre-trained YOLOv5 model, the system can identify objects such as cameras, mobile phones, and laptops from images taken using a webcam.

The solution integrates OpenCV and JavaScript to enable real-time webcam capture within the Colab environment. Once an image is captured, it is processed by YOLOv5 to highlight and label any detected objects that may pose a privacy threat. This approach provides a simple and accessible tool for users to visually inspect their surroundings for potential surveillance devices using only a browser and webcam.
